dpkg-reconfigure locales

Here I chose fr_FR.UTF-8 UTF-8 and unselected en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8.

Output from locale:

LANG=fr_FR.UTF-8
LANGUAGE=fr_FR.UTF-8
LC_CTYPE="fr_FR.UTF-8"
LC_NUMERIC="fr_FR.UTF-8"

Content of /etc/default/locale:

LANG=fr_FR.UTF-8
LANGUAGE=fr_FR.UTF-8

Content of /etc/default/keyboard:

# KEYBOARD CONFIGURATION FILE
# Consult the keyboard(5) manual page.
XKBMODEL="pc105"
XKBLAYOUT="fr"
XKBVARIANT="nodeadkeys"
XKBOPTIONS="terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp"
BACKSPACE="guess"

I ran setupcon after making these settings and it didn't change anything, the layout still was en_US.

After that, I ran

dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration

and set French - no dead keys as keyboard layout. Still no change, neither at once nor after a reboot.

Next, I tried

dpkg-reconfigure console-data

Here I chose

Choose layout from entire list

and then

pc / quertz / French / Standard / latin9 - no dead keys

The output after that was:

Looking for keymap to install:
fr-latin9-nodeadkeys
